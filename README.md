# Vigenere
Vigenere Cipherer &amp; Decipherer

A simple program to generate ciphers and deciphers of the Vigen√®re cipher.
It took me about 4 hours to make in total. 2.5 hours of which were spent on the cipher functions. The decipher was
very simple in theory and most of the code can be copied from the cipher functions with little difference.
It took 45 minutes to make the decipher, and the rest of the time was spent on debugging.

The program was built to be dynamic, and it supports any alphabet you could create with any one letter unicode
characters. It can also support any plain text and key, as well as keyed alphabet, but make sure that any letters
used in the 3 parameters mentioned are also included in the alphabet, or the program will fail.
